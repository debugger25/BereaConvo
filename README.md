Make sure that your support v4 library is up to date on the libraries and app to run properly 
      - Right click on target (library,app,etc)> android tools> add support library. 
      - After installing either clean the projects or restart eclipse if it is still not working. 
Also, make sure that both libraries are included in your project and open in eclipse.
